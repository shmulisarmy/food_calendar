# main process

in this version the main process is running on the front end with react btween at this point its not that much code to run the calculate function, how ever there might still be be a version of it on the back end for extra functionality or to hide the source code the user


# nessisary data 

all the nessiary data is preloaded in the file and soon ill work on making that local storage for the begining statges, in order to have a demo that works mostly on the front end to simplify things
